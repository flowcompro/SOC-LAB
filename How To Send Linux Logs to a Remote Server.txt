How I did it to send logs to a syslog host.  I only did the client , no need to do the server unless i am making the ubuntu the server

Run the command shown in the following image on the client device:

sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf

Within this file, we need to add a line with the following syntax:

*.* @@<Server-IP-Address>:<Port>

real example
*.* @@192.168.1.22:514

sudo service rsyslog restart

sudo ufw allow 514/tcp
sudo ufw allow 514/udp




Real instructions are below

How To Send Linux Logs to a Remote Server


This is to setup of a syslog server
To check if rsyslog is installed in your system and its status, execute the command shown in the following screenshot:

sudo service rsyslog status
If rsyslog isn’t active, you can start it by running the following command:

sudo service rsyslog start

You also can start rsyslog by running the following command:

Note: For additional information on managing Debian/Ubuntu services, read Stop, start, and restart services on Debian.

sudo systemctl start rsyslog


SERVER CONFIG

sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf

put the following entry 

$template RemoteLogs,”/var/log/%HOSTNAME%/RemoteLog.log”

*.* ?RemoteLogs

& ~

Scroll down the file and uncomment the following lines by removing the number sign (#) at the beginning of each line:

Module(load="imudp")

input(type="imudp" port="514")
Also, uncomment the following:

module(load=”imtcp”)

input(type=”imtcp” port=”514”)

To open the port 514 for the TCP and UDP protocol, run the command shown in the following image:

sudo ufw allow 514/tcp
sudo ufw allow 514/udp


sudo service rsyslog restart


That is it.


For the client

Run the command shown in the following image on the client device:

sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf

Within this file, we need to add a line with the following syntax:

*.* @@<Server-IP-Address>:<Port>
