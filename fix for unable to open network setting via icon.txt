Elevated command prompt, run gpedit.msc

Navigate to Computer Configuration->Windows Settings->Security Settings->Local Policies->Security Options

Enable "User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for the Built-in Administrator account"

Reboot and try again.

Not sure exactly why, but this fixes the issue for me.
