# SOC-LAB
This is what my SOC lab and activities surounding the lab environment for improving my cyber security skill set

My Security Operations Center (SOC) lab is a specialized environment in addtion to my current lab environment designed to provide hands-on training and practical experience in cybersecurity. It replicates real-world scenarios and threats to help me develop and advance the skills needed to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber incidents. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive breakdown of what my SOC lab contains:
1. Infrastructure and Hardware

    Servers: High-performance servers to simulate enterprise environments, host virtual machines, and run various services and applications.
    Workstations: Multiple workstations equipped with the necessary software and tools for trainees to use during exercises.
    Network Devices: Routers, switches, firewalls, and other networking equipment to replicate complex network topologies.
    Storage: Network-attached storage (NAS) or storage area networks (SAN) for hosting large datasets and logs.
    Monitoring and Display Systems: Large screens or video walls for real-time monitoring of network activities, alerts, and dashboards.

2. Software and Tools

    SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): Tools like Splunk, ArcSight, or QRadar for log collection, correlation, and analysis.
    Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Solutions like CrowdStrike or Carbon Black for monitoring and managing endpoint security.
    Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): Tools like Snort or Suricata for detecting and preventing network intrusions.
    Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIP): Systems like ThreatConnect or Anomali for aggregating and analyzing threat data.
    Vulnerability Management: Tools like Nessus, Qualys, or OpenVAS for scanning and identifying vulnerabilities.
    Forensics and Incident Response: Tools like Autopsy, EnCase, or FTK for digital forensics and incident investigation.
    Malware Analysis: Sandboxing environments like Cuckoo Sandbox for analyzing suspicious files and malware behavior.

3. Simulated Environment

    Virtual Machines (VMs): A variety of VMs running different operating systems (Windows, Linux) and configurations to mimic an enterprise network.
    Attack Scenarios: Pre-built scenarios involving various types of attacks (e.g., phishing, ransomware, DDoS) to train and test response capabilities.
    Realistic Traffic Generation: Tools to generate normal and malicious network traffic for realistic training.

4. Learning and Training Modules

    Cyber Range: An isolated environment where trainees can practice defending against live attacks without risk to real-world systems.
    Training Curriculum: Structured courses and modules covering various aspects of cybersecurity, including threat detection, incident response, and threat hunting.
    Documentation and Resources: Access to manuals, guides, cheat sheets, and reference materials.

5. Collaboration and Communication Tools

    Ticketing System: For managing incidents, tracking progress, and documenting response actions.
    Collaboration Platforms: Tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, for team coordination.
    Knowledge Base: A repository of previous incidents, lessons learned, and best practices for reference.

6. Security Policies and Procedures

    Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Detailed procedures for various SOC tasks and incident response actions.
    Playbooks: Step-by-step guides for handling specific types of incidents.
    Compliance and Governance: Tools and policies to ensure adherence to industry standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

7. Physical Security

    Access Control: Secure access to the SOC lab with key cards, biometric scanners, or other authentication mechanisms.
    Surveillance: Cameras and monitoring systems to ensure the physical security of the lab environment.

Additional Features

    Red Team/Blue Team Exercises: Simulated adversarial activities to test the defensive capabilities of the SOC.
    Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges: Interactive challenges to improve skills and knowledge in a competitive format.
    Continuous Improvement: Regular updates and enhancements to the lab environment and training materials based on emerging threats and technologies.
