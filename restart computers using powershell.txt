To use this script, create a text file called computerlist.txt and place it in the root of the C: drive. In this text file, specify the name or IP address of each computer that you want to restart, with one computer per line.

Then, run the script by opening a PowerShell window and entering .\restart-computers.ps1. The script will read the list of computers from the text file and restart each one in turn.

Note that this script will forcibly restart each computer, which means that any unsaved work will be lost. Make sure to save any important work before running the script.

  # Manually enter the computer names
  $computers = Read-Host "Enter the names of the computers to restart, separated by commas"
  $computers = $computers -split ","
