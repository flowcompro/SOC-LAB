Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Building a Server VM Using Hyper-V and PXE Boot
Purpose

This document provides step-by-step instructions for building a server Virtual Machine (VM) using Hyper-V and PXE boot. This SOP ensures that the process is standardized, efficient, and error-free.
Prerequisites

    A Windows Server with Hyper-V installed and configured.
    Network infrastructure supporting PXE boot (DHCP, TFTP server, etc.).
    ISO image or pre-configured WDS (Windows Deployment Services) for operating system deployment.
    Administrative access to the Hyper-V server.

Procedure
Step 1: Open Hyper-V Manager

    Log in to the Windows Server where Hyper-V is installed.
    Open Hyper-V Manager from the Start menu or by typing virtmgmt.msc in the Run dialog (Win + R).

Step 2: Create a New Virtual Machine

    In Hyper-V Manager, click on the server name in the left pane.
    In the right pane, under Actions, click on "New" and then select "Virtual Machine".
    Click "Next" on the New Virtual Machine Wizard welcome page.

Step 3: Specify Name and Location

    Enter a name for the VM (e.g., "ServerVM").
    Optionally, choose a different location to store the VM files.
    Click "Next".

Step 4: Assign Memory

    Specify the amount of memory (RAM) for the VM (e.g., 4096 MB).
    Optionally, enable Dynamic Memory if required.
    Click "Next".

Step 5: Configure Networking

    Choose the appropriate virtual switch for the VM to connect to the network.
    Click "Next".

Step 6: Connect Virtual Hard Disk

    Select "Create a virtual hard disk".
    Specify the name, location, and size of the virtual hard disk (e.g., 60 GB).
    Click "Next".

Step 7: Installation Options

    Select "Install an operating system from a network-based installation server".
    Ensure that the network adapter is set to boot from the network (PXE boot).
    Click "Next".

Step 8: Completing the Wizard

    Review the summary of the VM settings.
    Click "Finish" to create the VM.

Step 9: Configure the VM for PXE Boot

    Right-click on the newly created VM and select "Settings".
    In the left pane, select "Firmware".
    Ensure that the "Network Adapter" is listed as the first boot device.
    Click "Apply" and then "OK".

Step 10: Start the VM

    In Hyper-V Manager, right-click on the VM and select "Start".
    The VM will attempt to boot from the network using PXE.
    Follow the prompts to install the operating system using PXE boot.

Step 11: Monitor the Installation

    Use the VM's console to monitor the installation process.
    Complete the operating system setup as per your organization's standard procedures.

Step 12: Post-Installation Configuration

    Install any necessary drivers and updates.
    Configure network settings, hostname, and other system settings.
    Install additional software and configure the server as required.

Step 13: Backup and Documentation

    Take a snapshot or backup of the VM for future reference.
    Document the VM settings, installation steps, and any configuration changes made.

Notes

    Ensure that the DHCP and TFTP servers are correctly configured for PXE boot.
    Verify network connectivity and permissions before starting the installation process.
    Review and comply with organizational policies for server deployment and configuration.

Troubleshooting

    If the VM does not boot from the network, verify the PXE boot settings and network adapter configuration.
    Ensure that the DHCP server is providing the correct PXE boot information.
    Check the TFTP server logs for any errors or issues during the boot process.
