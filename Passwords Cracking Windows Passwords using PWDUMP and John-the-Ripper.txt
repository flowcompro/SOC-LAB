If not create a new user with a simple password (eg. password) and do the lab again.Do research on the internet to answer the following:The first password John the Ripper cracks is known as the LANMAN hash. Find out exactly what the LANMAN hash is and why it is easy to crack.What types of passwords can you choose that make the LANMAN hash more difficult to crack?Why does Windows still store the LANMAN hash?Is it possible to tell Windows not to store the LANMAN hash? If so, what conditions need to be met to allow this to happen? If not, why not?NTLM and NTLMv2 were the next iterations of authentication protocol used by Windows.
