However if u like to have freedom to choose, to execute show run without more you can use this method.

 

1. Type "terminal length 0" in privileged mode to set your terminal to display without any breaks.

2. Type "show run" or "show start" to show the applicable config. The config will display without any breaks or pauses.

 

To display the config without lengthy certificate data, use "show run brief ".

 

This is useful for capturing the complete config for documentation purposes, especially if you do not have access via TFTP or the like.

On a Cisco Wireless LAN Controller:
 

1. Type "config paging disable" in priviledged mode to set your terminal to display without any breaks.

 

2. Type "show run-config" to display the config.

To change terminal line display there are two commands you can use:

 

1) pager : Sets the number of lines to display in a Telnet session before the "---more---" prompt. This command is saved to the configuration.

 

2) terminal pager:Sets the number of lines to display in a Telnet session before the "---more---" prompt. This command is not saved to the configuration.

 

The default is 24 lines; 0 means no page limit.

 

1. Type "pager 0" in priviledged mode to set your terminal to display without any breaks.

 

2. Type "show run-config" to display the config.
