Basic Networking and Linux Skills

    Study networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, etc.).
    Gain proficiency in Linux commands and shell scripting.
    Familiarize yourself with common networking tools (ping, traceroute, netcat).

Penetration Testing Methodologies

    Learn the phases of a penetration test (reconnaissance, scanning, enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation).
    Understand ethical hacking principles and legal considerations.

Reconnaissance Techniques

    Practice using tools like Nmap, Recon-ng, and OSINT frameworks to gather information about targets.
    Learn to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability Scanning

    Use tools such as Nessus, OpenVAS, and Nikto to identify vulnerabilities.
    Learn how to interpret scan results and prioritize vulnerabilities.

Exploitation of Vulnerabilities

    Study common vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    Practice exploiting vulnerabilities using tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and manual techniques.

Privilege Escalation

    Learn Linux and Windows privilege escalation techniques.
    Practice exploiting misconfigurations, weak permissions, and kernel vulnerabilities.

Password Attacks

    Practice brute-forcing and dictionary attacks using tools like Hydra, John the Ripper, and Hashcat.
    Learn about common password policies and best practices for cracking passwords.

Buffer Overflow Exploitation

    Understand the principles of buffer overflows and memory management.
    Practice writing buffer overflow exploits and using tools like Immunity Debugger.

Web Application Exploitation

    Study web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and file inclusion.
    Practice exploiting web applications using tools like Burp Suite, SQLmap, and manual techniques.

Post-Exploitation Techniques

    Learn to maintain access using backdoors, rootkits, and persistence mechanisms.
    Practice data exfiltration and lateral movement within compromised networks.

Custom Exploit Development

    Study assembly language and shellcoding.
    Practice writing custom exploits and payloads.

Enumeration and Information Gathering

    Use tools like Enum4linux, SNMPwalk, and SMBclient to gather information from targets.
    Practice identifying valuable data and sensitive information.

Active Directory and Windows Network Exploitation

    Study Active Directory structure and common vulnerabilities.
    Practice exploiting Windows networks and understanding domain trust relationships.

CTF (Capture The Flag) Challenges

    Participate in online CTF platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and VulnHub.
    Solve challenges to practice various penetration testing skills in a controlled environment.

OSCP Lab Environment

    Use the official Offensive Security Proving Grounds (OSPG) or other practice labs to simulate real-world penetration testing scenarios.
    Practice working within a time limit and documenting your findings effectively.

Reporting and Documentation

    Practice writing detailed penetration testing reports.
    Learn to document findings, methodologies, and recommendations clearly and professionally.
