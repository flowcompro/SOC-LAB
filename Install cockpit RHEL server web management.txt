I did it using  https://www.linuxbuzz.com/install-cockpit-web-console-on-rhel/


How I did it


1) Install Cockpit Package
Cockpit package and its dependencies are available in the default RHEL 9 yum repositories. So, it’s installation is straight forward, open terminal and run following dnf command.

$ sudo dnf install cockpit -y
dnf-install-cockpit-rhel9

If you wish to manage KVM virtual machines using cockpit console then install following,

$ sudo dnf install cockpit-machines -y
In addition, if you want to manage podman containers from cockpit console, then install following,

$ sudo dnf install cockpit-podman -y
Install-cockpit-podman-rhel9
2) Start Cockpit Service
Once the package is installed, we need to enable the Cockpit service so it can automatically start on boot. To do this, run the following command:

$ sudo systemctl start cockpit
Run following systemctl command to verify it’s service

$ sudo systemctl status cockpit

3) Configure Firewall Rule for Cockpit
Cockpit runs on port 9090 by default. If you have a firewall enabled on your server, you will need to open this port to allow access to the web console. To do this, run the following commands:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=9090/tcp –permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd –reload
4) Access Cockpit Web Console
Now that the Cockpit service is enabled and the firewall is configured, you can access the web console by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:

https://<Your-Server-IP>:9090











This is from RED Hat site

To install the cockpit package just issue the below command-line:

Raw
# yum install -y cockpit
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 includes the RHEL 9 web console installed by default in many installation variants.

Raw
# rpm -qa | grep cockpit
Enable the cockpit service and start using Cockpit

Raw
# systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
If the web console was not installed by default on your installation variant and you are using a custom firewall profile, add the cockpit service to firewalld to open port 9090 in the firewall:

Raw
# firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent
# firewall-cmd --reload

Open any browser and in the address add http://server-ip:9090 or http://localhost:9090, and log in by providing the username and password
