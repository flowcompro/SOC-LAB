IT/OT Infrastructure Records Management Plan

Purpose: The purpose of this Records Management Plan (RMP) is to establish the framework for managing records related to the Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) infrastructure of the organization. This plan ensures that records are created, maintained, used, and disposed of in compliance with legal, regulatory, and business requirements. The plan also facilitates operational efficiency, improves accountability, and ensures data integrity within the IT/OT ecosystem.

1. Scope and Objectives

This RMP applies to all records generated, received, or maintained by the IT/OT department. It covers both electronic and physical records, focusing on critical operational, compliance, and legal documents related to the IT/OT infrastructure. The main objectives of the plan are to:

Ensure the proper creation, classification, storage, and retrieval of IT/OT records.
Comply with industry regulations and standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, SOX, HIPAA).
Protect sensitive records from unauthorized access, loss, or destruction.
Support the organization’s ability to audit, monitor, and ensure accountability.
Facilitate disaster recovery and business continuity through proper records management.
2. Record Types

Records within the IT/OT infrastructure are categorized based on function, system, and criticality. The following are the primary categories of records to be managed:

A. Administrative Records

IT/OT Policies, Procedures, and Guidelines
Change Management Logs
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with third-party vendors
Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans
IT/OT Incident Response Plans
B. System and Network Configuration Records

Network Diagrams and Topology Maps
Server, Router, and Switch Configuration Files
Firewall Rules and Configuration Logs
VPN Setup Records
Access Control Lists (ACLs) for Network Devices
Firmware, Patch, and Update Logs for IT/OT Devices
C. Security and Compliance Records

Security Policies and Risk Assessments
Audit Logs (User Activity, Firewall, System Access)
Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing Reports
Incident Response Logs and Security Event Summaries
Encryption and Key Management Logs
Regulatory Compliance Records (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
D. Operations and Maintenance Records

OT System Maintenance Logs (PLC, SCADA, DCS)
IT Infrastructure Maintenance Logs (Servers, Network Devices)
System Uptime/Downtime Logs and Performance Reports
IT/OT Integration and Synchronization Reports
Monitoring System Alerts and Reports
Equipment Calibration and Certification Logs
E. Software and Application Records

Software Licenses and Renewal Documentation
Application Configuration Files
Backup and Recovery Logs
Software Patch and Update Logs
API Documentation and Integration Records
Custom Application Source Code Management
F. User and Access Records

User Access Requests and Approval Forms
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Logs
Privileged Access Management (PAM) Logs
Remote Access Logs for IT/OT Systems
User Creation, Modification, and Deletion Records
G. Incident Management and Troubleshooting Records

Incident and Event Tickets (Help Desk, Security, System Failures)
Root Cause Analysis Reports
Problem Resolution Logs
Troubleshooting and Repair Documentation
Communication Records During Major IT/OT Incidents
3. Record Classification

Records are classified based on their importance and sensitivity. The classification tiers are:

Critical: These records are crucial for regulatory compliance, legal discovery, or system recovery (e.g., security logs, network configurations).
Operational: Required for the day-to-day functioning of IT/OT systems (e.g., performance reports, maintenance logs).
Administrative: Necessary for governance and decision-making processes (e.g., policies, procedures).
Historical: Records of significant past events or configurations that are maintained for reference or legal reasons (e.g., past audits, decommissioned systems).
4. Retention Schedule

Retention periods for each type of record must align with organizational policy, legal requirements, and industry standards. Below is a sample retention schedule:

Record Type	Retention Period	Reason
Policies, Procedures, SLAs	Until Superseded + 5 Years	Governance, Compliance
Security Logs (Audit, Firewall, Access)	1 Year (Critical Logs: 5 Years)	Regulatory (e.g., SOX, NIST)
Network Diagrams and Configurations	Until Decommissioned + 5 Years	Operational Integrity
Incident Response and Event Logs	3–5 Years	Compliance, Forensic Analysis
Maintenance and Performance Logs	3 Years	Operational Tracking
Backup and Recovery Logs	6 Months – 1 Year	Operational Requirements
Vendor Contracts, SLAs	Contract Expiry + 6 Years	Legal and Financial Protection
User Access Records	3–5 Years	Security, Compliance
Software Licenses	Life of Software + 3 Years	Compliance, License Audits
5. Access and Security Controls

To ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IT/OT records, the following access controls and security measures will be implemented:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Records access will be restricted based on the user’s role, ensuring that only authorized personnel can view or modify specific records.
Encryption: All sensitive records (e.g., security logs, user access logs) will be encrypted both at rest and in transit.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Access to systems storing critical IT/OT records will require MFA to mitigate unauthorized access risks.
Monitoring and Alerts: All access to critical records will be logged and monitored. Alerts will be generated for suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
Audit Trails: Complete audit trails will be maintained to ensure the integrity of records and allow for forensic investigations.
6. Record Creation and Maintenance

Metadata Standards: Each record will include metadata such as the creator, creation date, version, and record type for ease of identification and retrieval.
Version Control: A robust version control system will be in place to manage changes to critical records (e.g., network configurations, policies).
Backup Strategy: Regular backups of all records will be performed, stored securely, and tested periodically to ensure data recovery capabilities.
Documentation Standards: All records must be properly documented, accurate, and stored in approved systems to ensure consistency and reliability.
7. Record Storage and Archiving

Storage Platforms: IT/OT records will be stored in secure and compliant platforms, such as document management systems, cloud-based solutions (for non-sensitive records), or secure on-premise servers.
Archiving: Records that are no longer needed for active operations but must be retained for legal or historical purposes will be archived according to the retention schedule.
Physical Records: Any physical records (e.g., printed network diagrams) will be digitized and securely stored. If physical records are necessary, they will be kept in a secure, access-controlled environment.
8. Destruction of Records

Records that have reached the end of their retention period will be securely destroyed. Destruction methods include:

Electronic Records: Use of secure deletion tools that ensure permanent removal of data from all storage media.
Physical Records: Shredding of paper records, with a destruction certificate to confirm completion.
Compliance with Regulations: Destruction must adhere to any legal or regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR’s “right to be forgotten” or other industry-specific data protection laws).
9. Monitoring, Review, and Auditing

The Records Management Plan will be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in legal requirements, technology, and operational needs. Key actions include:

Regular Audits: The IT/OT records system will be audited annually to ensure compliance with internal and external requirements.
Review Cycle: Policies, retention schedules, and processes will be reviewed bi-annually and updated as necessary.
Non-Compliance Reports: Instances of non-compliance with the RMP will be documented, and corrective action plans will be implemented promptly.
10. Training and Awareness

All IT/OT personnel will receive training on the Records Management Plan, focusing on:

Record creation, classification, and retention requirements.
Security and access control for sensitive records.
Procedures for proper disposal of records.
Updates on legal and regulatory changes impacting records management.
Conclusion

This Records Management Plan provides a framework for the secure, compliant, and efficient management of IT/OT infrastructure records. It supports the organization's objectives of operational excellence, legal compliance, and data protection. Through proper implementation and continuous improvement, this plan ensures the longevity, integrity, and accessibility of critical records.
